      --- Chapter I: The wonder of emptiness ---

There are multiple philosophies implemented in this game.
It is an attempt to raise the questions of whether or not
there is any meaning or value in anything, and it is a
novel endeavour at aiming to answer these questions, as it
takes the form of a video game. A hyper-minimalist video game.
