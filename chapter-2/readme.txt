     --- Chapter II: The beauty of intricacy ---

This game is currently just a way for me to improve my
programming skill in the best programming language, C.

=== HOW TO RUN THE GAME ===

First, install the SDL2 library.
There is information on the internet that explains
how to do this. Then,

`$ git clone https://github.com/joshhartigan/bush-game`
`$ cd bush-game/chapter-2`
`$ mkdir bin`
`$ make`
`$ ./saddle`
